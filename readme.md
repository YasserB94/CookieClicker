- [ ] Upgrade Ideas
  - [ ] The user sells a cookie every x seconds and gains money to buy upgrades instead of using cookies
    - [ ] Study Economy -> Cookies are converted to money quicker (Better business plan, more sales)
    - [ ] Improve Recipe -> Cookies are converted to more money (Nicer cookies, larger price)
    - [ ] Invest -> The user invests its current money and will get a passive money income
  - [ ] Hire staff the user gets a helper that bakes cookies in a passive manner Tough good work aint cheap and cheap work aint good, *So tip your bartender!*
    - [ ] Upgrade staff -> Train staff/hire someone better that has less chance of burning a cookie
    - [ ] Improve Work conditions -> Staff will bake at a faster rate
    - [ ] Possible debuff! The staff spills and ruins a batch of cookies in the shop - halves the cookies you bake for a bit
    - [ ] Possible buff! The staff motivates you and gives you x seconds chance of double cookies\
    - [ ] Multiple staff members ??
  - [ ] The user bakes cookies by clicking
    - [ ] Improve baking skills -> Less chance to burn a cookie
    - [ ] Improve Oven -> Amount of cookies that make it into the store has the chance to be a higher number
    - [ ] Holiday -> No cookies can be sold/made for x time, but when the time ends you get double sales and double cookies baked for x seconds(Battery recharged!)
